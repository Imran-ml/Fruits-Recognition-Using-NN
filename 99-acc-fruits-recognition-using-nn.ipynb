Batch size is a term used in machine learning and refers to the number of training examples utilized in one iteration. \n","- Epochs =30 so the model will train on the data 30 times.Epoch is a term used in machine learning and indicates the number of passes of the entire training dataset the machine learning algorithm has completed.\n","- We can choose batch_size, and epochs as we want so the good practice is to set some values and train the model if the model will not give the good results we can change it and then try again for the training of the model. We can repeat this process many time untill we will not get the good results and this process called as parameter tuning."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"2ac38a4408414793435002ff4af1ab25bbf082a8","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-19T12:21:16.412996Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-19T12:21:16.413768Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["history = model.fit(x_train,y_train,\n","        batch_size = 32,\n","        epochs=30,\n","        validation_data=(x_valid, y_vaild),\n","        verbose=2, shuffle=True)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<h1> We need to do all the above configurations to train the model.
